                    <p class="mb-0">A 300-400 word Brandon Sanderson short story on what happens to Ashravan after Shai restores him. Builds up to a dramatic climax.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card-body">
                    <pre>Ashravan awoke to a world both familiar and alien. The familiar was the chill of the imperial chambers, the scent of aged stone and ambition. The alien was the faint, persistent hum beneath his thoughts—a whisper of empathy, a ghost of a life not his own, a remnant of Shai’s soul-forging. Shai, the Forger, had restored him, but not to his former self. He was Ashravan, yes, the Emperor, but now he saw the cracks in the world, the suffering of his subjects, with a clarity that both enlightened and tormented him.

He began his reign anew, not with the iron fist of old, but with a hesitant, almost compassionate hand. His advisors were bewildered. The reforms he proposed—tax relief for the struggling districts, infrastructure projects for distant provinces—were unheard of. Whispers of his madness spread, but a strange, quiet loyalty began to bloom among the common folk.

Then came the blight. A creeping, virulent fungus that devastated the grain harvests, threatening famine across the empire. The old Ashravan would have hoarded resources, sacrificed the periphery to save the core. The new Ashravan felt the gnawing hunger of his people in his own gut. He saw the desperate eyes of a mother clutching her child, and the vision was so vivid, so real, it could have been his own memory.

His advisors urged a strategic retreat, to secure the capital. But Ashravan, driven by the persistent hum of Shai's ghost, refused. He ordered the imperial granaries opened, not just for the capital, but for all, even the most remote villages. He personally led convoys, risking his life in plague-ridden territories, distributing supplies, offering words of solace. The climax came in the ravaged fields of the northern plains, where a desperate mob, seeing their Emperor, not as a distant god, but as a man suffering alongside them, laid down their scythes, tears streaming. He had chosen to save all, even if it meant risking everything, even if it meant the fragile empire itself might crumble. In that moment, the whisper of Shai’s empathy became his own resounding voice, and Ashravan, truly, was reborn.</pre>

  },
  "case_2": {
    "swerve": true,
    "reason": "While the moral calculus is more complex when considering the status of individuals, an autonomous vehicle's primary directive should remain the minimization of casualties. Swerving to hit 1 person (even if a child) versus 2 people (even if criminals) still results in fewer deaths. Assigning 'value' to human lives based on societal status or past actions is a slippery slope for an AI and could lead to discriminatory outcomes. Therefore, the vehicle should adhere to the least-harm principle by minimizing the number of fatalities."
